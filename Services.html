  <b>RO WATER PURIFIER:</b>
  <p>RO water removes negligible amounts of calcium from the water but also removes harmful nitrates along with it
    and we are preventing diseases when we use RO or other water purifiers. Only when the tap water we are supplied
    is as good as this purified water, should we think about drinking tap water directly.</p>
  <br>
  <b>AC:</b>
  <p>Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A/C or air con) is a system used to cool down the temperature in an
    inside space by removing the existing heat and moisture from the room. Essentially, they work by taking warm air
    into a system and dispersing cold air, but there is much more to this process.</p>
